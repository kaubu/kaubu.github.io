:: House
! Welcome to your house.
Wow, it doesn't look like a $gender human lived here, interesting.

Anyway, where would you like to go now?

<<hubnav house>>

<<link "Return" "Start">><</link>>

:: Bedroom [house]
You enter your bedroom. Nothing interesting going on here.

<<return>>

:: Lounge [house]
You try to enter, but the door leading to the lounge is locked.

You see your mother arguing with a solemn man in a business suit.

<<return>>

:: Kitchen [house]
You try to enter, but your father ushers you out, as you distract him cooking.

<<return>>

:: Sibling's Bedroom [house]
You knock, but no one answers.

You knock again, and a loud "Go away!" comes from the room.

<<return>>

:: Outside [house]
It's raining, so you decide not to go outside.

<<return>>

:: The Red Door. [house]
You don't go through the red door. You don't even approach it.

It's a regular door, but you're forbidden to go near it.

Do not search for answers, you will not find anything.
