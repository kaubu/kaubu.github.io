### Germanic Thesaurus (Copyable)
The original Germanic Thesaurus (which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nf_aF_hmDQnYyiwJbGdX4kdwIST_VUziRqXp0AfE2Yk/edit)) is quite authoritarian, in that it disallowed copying.

I disliked that, so I made a copy that is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x-GB6AjZu_CYlxTit1n260i6xV9qxZXQk1N9X4oJAPI/edit?usp=sharing), and this copy allows copying, so you can copy it for your own.
